# Summary 

This is a repo for [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) by Stanford University on Coursera.
It is a 4 course specialization. The code are algorithms implemented by me for tyring to solve the problems in the courses.

## Course 1

[Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer).

### Week 1

[Merge sort](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera-algorithms-specialization/blob/master/course-1/week-1/merge_sort.py)<br>
[Recursive Multiplication](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera-algorithms-specialization/blob/master/course-1/week-1/recursive_multiply.py)<br>


### Week 2

[Counting Inversions](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera-algorithms-specialization/blob/master/course-1/week-2/count_inversions.py)<br>

### Week 3

[Quick Sort](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera-algorithms-specialization/blob/master/course-1/week-3/quick_sort.py)

### Week 4

The algorithm this week is random contraction. I implemented in 2 ways. I came up with the 1st one.
It uses simple list operation, without using class. It is a bit slow, but it gets the job done. 
The 2nd one is more of learning for me because I learned it from another repo (reference link 
in my script). It uses class to represent adjacency, which leads to clearer code.
